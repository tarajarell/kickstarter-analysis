# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to synthesize information for Louise, who is seeking analysis on plays to better understand how to findraise for her own productions. Following her fundraising efforts for one play, she sought a comparison of how other fundraising efforts had fared - particularly in relation to launch date and fundraising goal amount. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The Kickstarter data set indicates that overall that there were more successful theater outcomes than failed, and that there were more failed outcomes than cancelled fundraisers. Successful months for theater fundraisers peaked in May, and failed fundraisers for theater projects were at their highest May thorugh August and again in October. Cancelled fundraising intitiatives maintained a low and steady trend. There appear to be zero cancelled fundraising campaigns in October. December showed the lowest amount of successful theater fundraising campaigns, with September and November showing the lowest numbers of failed fundraising initiatives.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Goal amounts appear to have a slight overall upward trend among failed play fundraising, and a slight overall downward trend among successful play fundraising. Data from goal amounts in the range of $35000-44999 appear to be against this trend, while the fundraising campaigns with goals of $45000 or more added to the trends previously described. There were no cancelled play fundraising initiatives found in the Kickstarter data set. An even split in the percentage of successful vs failed fundraising campaigns occurred when the goal amount was $15000-19999, while there was a 100% failure outcome when play fundraising goals were $45000-49999. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges in compiling this data into visuals for client comprehension included changing the data information from Theater to Plays between data analysis. The data sets utilized not only changed in what outcomes were being compared against (goal amount and launch date) but also by categories with the parent category of theater (for launch date) and the subcategory of plays (by goal amount). This complicated some aspects of comparing the data sets as one included larger numbers while the other was more specific and more similar to what Louise's fundraising goals were. It was also difficult to discuss overall Outcomes Based on Goals with the goal criteria being chunked into amounts of $5000s. This did not allow for the graph to scale how many data points were in each goal category. For example, there were 500 total projects in the $1000-4999 goal section (with 73% successful and 27% failed) and 1 total project in the $45000-49999 goal section (with 0% successful and 100% failed), while the chart shows these differences with the same weight on the graph, based on overall percentage.

### Some other possible tables and graphs that we could create
Data variability in the line graph for Outcomes Based on Goals led interpretation of an overall trend difficult to visually analyze. With the addition of a graph showing the trend lines (below), the visual analysis of overall outcomes for play fundraising data may have lent to better interpretation and use by the client.

To account for differences in comparing the findraising outcomes based on launch date (for theater) and the outcomes based on fundraising goals (for plays), a graph could have been created to demonstrate a visual analysis of the fundraising outcomes for plays based on launch dates.

Additionally, to find the most recent analysis, graphs for the outcomes for *only* 2015-2017 data could have been included in the analysis. These were the most recent dates foundin the Kickstarter data, and may emulate the most recent trends in fundraising as compared with dates from durther back.
